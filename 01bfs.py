# there is no need of visited in 01 bfs
# In 0-1 BFS, we often donâ€™t explicitly need a visited set because the algorithm's structure naturally ensures that no node is revisited unnecessarily. 
# This is due to the properties of the deque and the edge relaxation process. 
# infinite loop pe nai jayega kabhi bhi bcs of this condition:..... if curr_dist < dist[child]
